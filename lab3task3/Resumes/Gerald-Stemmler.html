			About me:
		</h2>
		<h3>
			<p>
			I was born in Kingston, ON but moved to Cornwall, ON in grade 1. I developed an interest in computers from my dad because he did networking at Nav-Canada. 
			I also played a lot of video games which I really loved so after highschool I decided to take the game-dev course. I completed the course but decided to go back for the networking course. </br>
			I am still going to try to get a job in game development because that would be great!
